## This code is a Python script that allows you to save and load data from the clipboard using specified keys. The data is stored in a JSON file for persistence between script runs. The script takes command-line arguments to perform various operations such as saving, loading, listing, and deleting data.

### Here's a brief description of the available commands:

 <li>save: Saves the current contents of the clipboard under a specified key. It prompts you to enter a key using a lock emoji (🔐) and displays a checkmark emoji (✅) upon successful data saving.</li> ---
 <li>load: Loads the data associated with a specified key from the JSON file and copies it to the clipboard. It prompts you to enter a key using a key emoji (🔑) and notifies you with a clipboard emoji (📋) upon successful data copying.</li>---
 <li>
list: Prints all the saved key-value pairs from the JSON file. It displays the saved data using a scroll emoji (📜) to indicate a list.</li>---
 <li>
delete: Deletes the data associated with a specified key from the JSON file. It prompts you to enter a key using a locked padlock emoji (🔒) and provides a waste bin emoji (🗑️) as feedback upon successful data deletion.</li>
